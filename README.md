# Welcome
These are the project files for the game that tests out the hypothesis of this paper: https://doi.org/10.47611/jsrhs.v12i1.3913 

# How It Was Made 
The game was coded in C# using Visual Studio Code. The engine used was Unity, with a build target of mobile phones. It uses your microphone input to control a sidescrollling character similar to a rhythm game. It uses fourier transform to achieve real-time musical note recognition. There's a backing track that plays in each level and notes show up over each obstacle and objective which you need to play whenever it hits your character. All sprites were drawn in Paint.net and were animated inside Unity's animation editor. 

# The Story 
The game's premise is that you are princess that was abducted by monsters and are currently stuck in an underground dungeon. One night a magical spirit possesses you and gives you superhuman strength. You are able to break out and each level gets you closer to escaping whether that's by fishing or fighting off goblins.
